[Code Checklist]

Editor:
    Setup file types to automatically open by proper application, Example: .pdf by Adobe Reader
    
Naming Convention:
    Field name start with m_ , Example: m_PrimaryId
    Parameters start with p_ , Example: p_Filename
    Local variables are Camel case, Example: returnValue
    Properties/Methods are Pascal case, Example: SystemPassword
    Don't use 'this', use m_XYZ instead
    
Spacing/Tabs:
    Insert spaces instead of tabs
    Use 4 spaces per tab indention
    
Exception Handling:
    Use custom exception classes derived from ApplicationException
    Exceptions are expensive, use only when necessary
    When re-throwing, send previous exception data
    Thrown an exception, versus returning a Boolean, so more detailed info is available to the caller
    Only catch an exception for cleanup purposes or to shield end user from error message

Code Folding:
    Use #region/#endregion around similar blocks of code

Build Settings:
    Use debug during development
    Do release build of binaries during release
    Change web.config, if necessary, to not use debugging

Type Names:
    Use the full type name, instead of abbreviation, Example: use Boolean, not bool

Comments:
    Include comments in code, just not too much
    
Project Settings:
    Add a Documentation project to each solution

General:
    Make code as small as possible - the fewest moving parts
